# Stark101rs

> This project is a WIP

## Main Target

After being immersed in the STARK101 tutorial from **STARKWARE**, we found it would be valuable to create a Rust implementation, since many cryptography projects are written in Rust.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Provide a Rust implementation of the STARK101 tutorial concepts
- Help developers understand STARKs through clear, well-documented Rust code
- Serve as a learning resource for both STARK proofs and Rust programming

## TODOs

### Basic Components

- [ ] `polynomials`
- [ ] `merkle`
- [ ] `channel`

### Constraint

> Disclaimer: The operations in this project are not optimized and should not be used in production.
